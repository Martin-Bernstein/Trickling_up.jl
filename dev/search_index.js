For there to be a unique solution for y given the state x, there must be N stable eigenvalues (i.e. with negative real part) of mathbfA.\n\nLet mathbfA = QUQ be the Schur decomposition of mathbfA, where Q is unitary and U is upper triangular. Assuming that this is decomposition is made such that the stable eigenvalues of U are at the top left, we can write: [     U=\\begin{pmatrix}U{ss}&U{su}\\0&U{uu}\\end{pmatrix}     \\hspace{1cm}     Q=\\begin{pmatrix}Q{xs} & Q{xu} \\ Q{ys} & Q{yu}\\end{pmatrix} ] where the N-by-N upper left block Uss$ maps the stable subspace to itself, the N-by-N Q_xs maps the stable subspace to x, etc.\n\nGiven any state x, we can obtain the rotated stable state by solving s = Q_xs^-1*x. Then dots = U_ss*s, and dotx = Q_xs*dots = Q_xs*U_ss*Q_xs^-1.  The jump variables y can be obtained from s by y = Q_yx*s = Q_yx*Q_xs^-1*x.\n\nSumming up, our model will have law of motion [ \\dot{x} = Bx \\hspace{1cm} y = Fx ] where B = Q_xs*U_ss*Q_xs^-1 and F = Q_yx*Q_xs^-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
